- **React Components**: Built using React to create reusable components.
- **Minimal Setup**: The project is set up with Vite for fast and optimized builds, allowing for an efficient development workflow.
- **Styled Components**: Modern CSS with styled components for maintainable and scalable styling.
- **Responsive Design**: The portfolio is fully responsive and works seamlessly across devices.

## Tech Stack

- **React** - A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite** - A fast build tool and development server optimized for modern web projects.
